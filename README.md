# PyCitySchools
Homework #4
The effort evauates the differences in reading and math grades/scores between a Charter school and a District school. It does so by looking at the average math and reading scores as well as the percentage passing for both reading and math. There is also a comparison based on school per capita. 

This effort was created with help from a tutor (Kourt), AskBCS and Google, as well as a lot of time and hard work. Also a lot of trial and error was involved in this effort.


# Observations (these can also be seen in the jupyter notebook as the last commented out code)
The first observation seen is that the overall % passing rate for Charter Schools is almost double as it is for District schools.

The second observation seen is that Charter Schools outperform District Schools in every category. Some categories more significantly than others. Average Reading Score is minimally different, however Average Math Score is moderately different. The most significant differences can be seen in the % Passing
Math and % Passing Reading.
